CIFAR-10 Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)


## Overview


CIFAR-10 Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CIFAR-10 dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
## Features

- Data Augmentation: Random cropping, flipping, and normalization for better generalization.
- Custom CNN: A CNN model designed specifically for the CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of:
   - Convolutional layers
   - Max-pooling layers
   - Fully connected layers
   - Dropout for regularization
- Training Optimization: Uses techniques like learning rate scheduling and Adam optimizer.
## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset includes the following classes:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck
Dataset details:

- Training samples: 50,000
- Test samples: 10,000
- Image dimensions: 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB)
